# Grpc-Gateway Golang Template

Grpc-Gateway is a project that showcases how to integrate gRPC and RESTful APIs using the gRPC-Gateway plugin. This project aims to provide a simple and clear example of how to use gRPC-Gateway to create a unified API service.

## Features

- **gRPC and RESTful APIs**: The project uses both gRPC and RESTful APIs, demonstrating the integration of these two different API styles.
- **gRPC-Gateway**: The project uses the gRPC-Gateway plugin to generate a reverse-proxy server that translates a RESTful JSON API into gRPC.
- **gRPC and Protocol Buffers**: The project uses gRPC and Protocol Buffers to define the service interface and the structure of payload messages.
